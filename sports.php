                This is the most commmon form of online betting in the United States. At websites like Bovada.lv, Sportsbook.ag, and TopBet.eu, users can create online betting accounts. Here they can deposit money via several methods, place bets, and get paid out in account money within minutes of their bet ending. Users can then withdraw their winnings and receive checks... or they can lose all of their money. These sites feature all major sports including the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, and European Soccer. All of these sites are located outside of the United States, as gambling is technically illegal in the U.S.
